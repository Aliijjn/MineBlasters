# MineBlasters üß®‚õèÔ∏è

Welcome to MineBlaster, my attempt at making a full, polished 2D game. I've been working on this project for a month (since 15-01-2025)

## What I've learned from this project: ‚úÖ
- How to procedurally generate levels
- The efficient use of algorithms (DDA, DFS)
- How to optimise performance and use multithreading (2000-3000fps!)
- How to manage a larger code base (~4000 lines)

## How to play the game üèÉ
- Download the zip file in the repo
- Unzip the file and enjoy :)
- You move with `WASD` and shoot with `MOUSE1` or `SPACEBAR`
- All other essential controls are shown when needed

# Technical specifications: ‚öôÔ∏è

## Map generation: üó∫Ô∏è
I'm quite proud of how the map generation turned out. Its design is rather simple, but doesn't break immersion and allows for great replayability. Here's the breakdown:
- **Step 1:**
Create a 2D grid with the width and height of `levelCount + 1` and fill it with 0's (open areas).
- **Step 2:**
Fill random elements of this grid with 1's (walls).
- **Step 3:**
Using a depth-first search, check if it's possible to get from the levels start {0, 0} to the levels exit {1, 1}. If not, go back to step 1.
- **Step 4:**
Assign each element in the grid a value based on which neighbours are open areas. e.g. if the grid has a neighbour to the right it gets +1, below +2, left +4 and above +8.
- **Step 5:**
Load the files from the folder chunks. Each is a unique 20x20 area, with chest and enemy spawns. They are numbered between 0 and 15, which are all possible combinations for neighbouring tiles which they need to connect to.
- **Step 6:**
Look up the values of the 2D array, and place the chunks in a new 2D array, that's 20x wider and higher.

## Map generation examples: üëÄ

## Real-Time Lighting: üî¶
In a 2D game, the player often gets too much information. This can make a game get boring quickly, as there's no element of surprise. To fix this, I made sure that the player can only see things that the player can actually see. I did this by casting rays between the player and all floor tiles and entities, to see if the player could really see them. If the line hits a wall before reaching the destination, the tile will be rendered with a darker shade and whatever is on top won't get rendered at all. However making this work, and making it run well was easier said than done. 

### Raycasting (DDA)
DDA is a great way of effectively casting rays. It takes a while to understand, but it's worth it for sure, as it's extremely fast. Speed is essential for my use case, as I need to check for each pixel of a tile *(32x32)* if the player can see it. There also wouldn't just be one tile, but close to *100* to render in a worst-case scenario. And you don't want to do this once every few seconds, but 60x per second minimum, or around *165x* per second for a smooth experience. This would result in **16,896,000** DDA calls per second!

Even then, the result wouldn't look too good, as the line would look jagged, with there only being only one sample per pixel. To fix this, four rays (samples) are sent out per pixel, which makes the edges appear much smoother, at the cost of some performance.

### Optimising the raycasting

### Fortunately, there are a few tricks that you can use to determine whether a tile should be lit. The easiest one of these is to check all corners of a tile, if the player can see all 4 of them, then he should be able to see the whole tile, meaning there's no need to check all pixels of the tile.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0bcb007-ba0a-461b-a78a-99fc5997ef10)

### This already decreases the amount of tiles we need to fully render by about 30%, but we can do better than this.

### However, the same thing isn't true in reverse, as you can still see the middle of a tile, while not seeing any of the corners.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/615493ca-b8e0-4858-86be-bb99142950ae)

### Though, you can check all of the first pixels that are facing the player. This is considerably more expensive, but an O(n) prediction that works 50% of the time is way better than O(n^2).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d18efbf2-6b7a-4599-86dc-625a9b09571a)

### Now that we can properly predict if a tile is fully invisible to the player, we can optimise another ~60% of the tiles
