# MineBlasters 🧨⛏️

Welcome to MineBlaster, my attempt at making a full, polished 2D game. I've been working on this project for a month (since 15-01-2025)

## What I've learned from this project ✅
- How to procedurally generate levels
- The efficient use of algorithms (DDA, DFS)
- How to increase performance using multithreading (800-2000fps!)
- How to manage a larger code base (~4000 lines)
